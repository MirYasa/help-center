There are certain risks. If the assets you stake experience a large price drop during the lock-up period, that can outweigh your staking rewards and you will probably lose some money.Â 

Algebra has solved this problem by allowing you to lock up ALGB for a minimum of 30 minutes, so you always have a chance to unstake your ALGB tokens and get them back to your wallet after 30 minutes.
