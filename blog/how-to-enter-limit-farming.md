Firstly, check out the available farming events on the “Farming” page (Limit Farms).

To take part in Limit Farming, you’ll need a relevant pool of tokens (in other words — your NFT token or position). So, make sure you have it. If you don’t, [provide liquidity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GRzlSy1AAh4iRKR9W30OCUtmTr3_7gVdK4Pzq-9MWCo/edit#heading=h.2wc3g5ylgxe4) first and create a pool.

If you have already got a relevant position and ready to farm, your steps will be the following:

1. Open the Algebra dApp and go to the “Farming’’ page.
2. Choose “Limit Farms’’, and then choose a farming event that complies with your pool tokens. It can be USDC/WETH, USDC/WMATIC and so on.

> Reminder! 
>
> * You need to enter a farming event in advance — before it starts. 
> * With one position, you can enter both Infinite and Limit Farms at once.
> * You can’t unlock your liquidity until Limit Farming finishes.

3. Click “Farm”.

Select the NFT.

4. Choose a tier. 

There are 3 tiers for Limit Farming:  **Bachelor**, **Master**, **Professor**. Each of them will increase your liquidity at a certain percentage. If you prefer to farm with no tier, you can choose “No Tier”. 

Keep in mind: If you don’t have ALGB tokens for a certain tier, you need to buy the necessary amount of ALGB. Click “Buy Algebra” in the opened window in the right upper corner.

5. Approve it with MetaMask. 

When you click “Deposit”, you’ll automatically start farming.

You’re in!

> **Please note:** If you see that our farming events include WMATIC whereas you have MATIC and want to participate, Algebra will automatically swap MATIC to WMATIC when you enter a farming event.
