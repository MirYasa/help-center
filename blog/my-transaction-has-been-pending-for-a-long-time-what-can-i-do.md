If your transaction has been pending for a long time, you have three available options.

1. Wait — the Algebra interface has a default transaction deadline setting of 30 minutes, after which the transaction will automatically fail. Once the transaction has failed, you can resubmit your transaction. 

2. Speed up — wallets like Metamask offer users the ability to speed up their transactions by re-submitting them with a higher gas price. This is not necessarily guaranteed to work.

**3. Cancel — wallets like Metamask also offer users the ability to cancel their transactions by submitting an ‘empty’ transaction with a higher gas price. This is not necessarily guaranteed to work.
