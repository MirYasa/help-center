Firstly, check out the available farming events on the “Farming” page (Infinite Farms).

To take part in Infinite Farming, you’ll need a relevant pool of tokens (in other words — your NFT token or a position). So, make sure you have it. If you don’t, [provide liquidity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GRzlSy1AAh4iRKR9W30OCUtmTr3_7gVdK4Pzq-9MWCo/edit#heading=h.2wc3g5ylgxe4) first and create a pool.

If you have already got a relevant position and ready to farm, your steps will be the following:

1. Open the Algebra dApp and go to the “Farming’’ page.



\==go to the farming page INF FARM==



1. Choose “Infinite Farms’’, and then choose a farming event that complies with your pool tokens. It can be USDC/WETH, USDC/WMATIC and so on.

\==click inf farming INF FARMS==

\==choose an event click farm INF FARMS==

> **Reminder!** With one position, you can enter both Infinite and Limit Farms at once.

3. Click “Farm”.

Select the NFT.

4. Approve it with MetaMask. 

When you click “Deposit”, you’ll automatically start farming.

You’re in!

> **Please note:** If you see that our farming events include WMATIC whereas you have MATIC and want to participate, Algebra will automatically swap MATIC to WMATIC when you enter a farming event
