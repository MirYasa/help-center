Algebra features 2 types of farming: Infinite Farming and Limit Farming.

Infinite Farming is permanent, where you’ll continue to be rewarded - starting at the very beginning - as long as you keep providing liquidity, which will never be locked. Lastly, you can join or withdraw at any time.

Limit Farming is temporary, where you’ll be rewarded for a certain period of time and will need to lock your tokens before the farming event starts. You can only withdraw and collect your rewards when the farm has completed.
