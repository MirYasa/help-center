If you have already provided liquidity on other DEXs, you can easily migrate it to Algebra. Here’s how to do that:

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet.

\==Click connect wallet SWAP==

2. Click “Migrate pool” on the “Pool” page.

\==go to the pool page and click migrate MIGRATING==

3. Click “Find it” if your liquidity pools were not listed automatically; manually selecting required pairs.
4. Click “Expand” if the LPs were listed automatically.



\==choose the pool click migrate MIGRATING==



5. Press “Migrate”.



\==click migrate MIGRATING==



6. Enter the price range.

   \==enter amounts MIGRATING==



7. Press “Migrate” once more and confirm the migration.

\==click migrate once again MIGRATING==



\==confirm your transaction MIGRATING==



In case of a difference in the current price or price range between DEXs, only a part of your assets will be migrated to the new pool; the other part will be transferred to your wallet.
