If you have already provided liquidity on other DEXs, you can easily migrate it to Algebra. Here’s how to do that:

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet.



\==Click connect wallet SWAP==



2. Click “Migrate pool” on the “Pool” page.



\==click remove liq==



3. Click “Find it” if your liquidity pools were not listed automatically; manually selecting required pairs.

4. Click “Expand” if the LPs were listed automatically.

5. Press “Migrate”.



\==click remove LIQ==



6. Enter the price range.



\==choose the amount of liq to be REMOVED==



7. Press “Migrate” once more and confirm the migration.



\==LIQ REMOVED==



In case of a difference in the current price or price range between DEXs, only a part of your assets will be migrated to the new pool; the other part will be transferred to your wallet.
