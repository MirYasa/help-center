If you already have liquidity on other DEXs, you can easily migrate it to Algebra. Here’s how to do that:

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet.
2. Press the “Migrate pool” button on the “Pool” page.
3. Click “Find it” if your liquidity pools were not listed automatically; manually selecting required pairs.
4. Click “Expand” if the LPs were listed automatically.
5. Press “Migrate”.
6. Enter the price range.
7. Press “Migrate” once more and confirm the migration.

In case of a difference in the current price or price range between DEXs, only a part of your assets will be migrated to the new pool; the other part will be transferred to your wallet.
