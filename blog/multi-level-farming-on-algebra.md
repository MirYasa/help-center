If you’re an ALGB holder, you can increase your liquidity with Multi-Level Farming when participating in Limit Farming events. Let’s see the exclusive farming conditions that you get with the Multi-Level Farming mechanism.

### How is This Type of Farming Different?

With Multi-Level Farming, you can choose one of three tiers when entering a Limit Farm. Each of them represents an extra coefficient which will multiply the amount of liquidity you provide. So, you will be able to get a greater income distributed in ALGB. Let’s see how it works.

1. **Buy ALGB tokens if you don’t have them yet**

To take advantage of these bonuses, you need to buy a certain amount of ALGB — or simply hold the ALGB you already have, besides locking up the two cryptocurrencies. The amount of ALGB tokens needed is specified in every tier’s description. If you are not an ALGB holder, you can purchase ALGB in the opened window with tiers. Click “Buy ALGB” in the upper right corner. 

2. **Choose a tier**

Choose your preferred tier that you want to increase your liquidity with during Limit Farming. The coefficients will be chosen and announced in advance for every farming event, so you’ll be able to choose the best option of the presented ones.

3. **Enter Limit Farming**

After making sure that you have ALGB tokens, lock up your liquidity and enjoy exclusive farming conditions with increased liquidity.

4. **Get Farming rewards with increased liquidity** 

When the farm is over, the ALGB or any other tokens will be returned to your wallet address.

Let’s suppose you entered an event of this type of farming and chose the 2nd tier, providing a 150% coefficient. This essentially means that your liquidity will be increased, raising the chances of getting even higher rewards by the end of an event. 

**Note:** if you want to boost the efficiency of your farming participation with two, three, or even more NFTs, and choose the tier for each farming event you are joining, you’ll need to complete the requirements for each farm. So, if you’re entering 2 farming events, and choosing the 2nd tier for both events, you’ll need to hold twice as many ALGB tokens.
