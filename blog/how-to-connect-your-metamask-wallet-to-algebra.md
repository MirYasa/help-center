If you already have Metamask wallet, here’s what yo do:

1. Go to [Algebra dApp](https://app.algebra.finance/#/farming/limit-farms).
2. Click on Connect Wallet.
3. If you don’t have the Polygon network set up for Metamask, it will be automatically added.

REMEMBER: Transactions on the Polygon network require its native token MATIC which will be used as gas fee. If you don’t have MATIC tokens on your wallet, you won’t be able to make a transaction with other tokens on Polygon.
