Rewards are distributed only among those providers whose liquidity was active for at least some time (when the price stays in the chosen range). Rewards for an ongoing event are approximate, and you will be able to see the final result only at the end of the farming event. Your rewards will be proportional to the amount of the liquidity you have provided.
