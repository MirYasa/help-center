In this how-to guide, you’ll get the whole scenario on how to start farming on Algebra and get great rewards.

Firstly, check out the available farming events on the “**Farming**” page (**Infinite Farms** and **Limit Farms**). [See the difference between Infinite Farms and Limit Farms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VaNo_HbVMstY30rA23BbOWdBmdifdoLjR94WMOiPFuE/edit#heading=h.dkekf791nv8).

To take part in farming, you’ll need a relevant pool of tokens (in other words - your NFT token). So, make sure you have it. If you don't, provide liquidity first and create a pool! To learn how to do it, read our [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_VbuE7CJDLPGdSTTvIrGikaqjfzUumsYi6H5U2Q0mRI/edit#heading=h.wyl6kj4stb9n).

Already got a relevant pool of tokens and ready to farm? Your next steps will be the following:

1. Open [the Algebra dApp](https://app.algebra.finance/#/swap) and go to the “**Farming**" page.
2. Choose “**Infinite Farms**" or “**Limit Farms**", and then choose a farming event that complies with your pool tokens. It can be USDC/WETH, ONE/IRIS, USDC/WMATIC, and so on.

**Reminder!** Regarding Limit Farms, you need to enter a farming event in advance - before it starts. With one pool of tokens, you can enter both Infinite and Limit farming at once.

Note that you can create a pool with any token necessary for farming on Algebra.

3. Click “**Farm**”. Select the NFT for the liquidity pool that you created earlier.

## What is Farming on Algebra?

Algebra allows you to provide liquidity and farm your crypto, all in one place and at the same time! Besides the fees you earn as a liquidity provider, you receive great APR from farming.

## Infinite & Limit Farming

Algebra features 2 types of farming: **Infinite Farming** and **Limit Farming**.

* **Infinite Farming** is permanent, where you’ll continue to be rewarded - starting at the very beginning - as long as you keep providing liquidity, which will never be locked. Lastly, you can join or withdraw at any time.
* **Limit Farming** is temporary, where you’ll be rewarded for a certain period of time and will need to lock your tokens before the farming event starts. You can only withdraw and collect your rewards when the farm has completed.
