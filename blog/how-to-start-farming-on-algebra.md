Firstly, check out the available farming events on the “Farming” page (Infinite Farms and Limit Farms).

Please note: If you see that our farming events include WMATIC whereas you have MATIC and want to participate, Algebra will automatically swap MATIC to WMATIC when you enter a farming event.

To take part in farming, you’ll need a relevant pool of tokens (in other words — your NFT token, position). So, make sure you have it. If you don’t, [provide liquidity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GRzlSy1AAh4iRKR9W30OCUtmTr3_7gVdK4Pzq-9MWCo/edit#heading=h.2wc3g5ylgxe4) first and create a pool.

If you have already got a relevant position and ready to farm, your steps will be the following:

1. Open the Algebra dApp and go to the “Farming’’ page.

2. Choose “Infinite Farms’’ or “Limit Farms’’, and then choose a farming event that complies with your pool tokens. It can be USDC/WETH, USDC/WMATIC and so on. 

Reminder!

* Regarding Limit Farms, you need to enter a farming event in advance — before it starts. 
* With one position, you can enter both Infinite and Limit Farms at once.

3. Click “Farm”.

Select the NFT.

4. Approve it with MetaMask. When you click “Deposit”, you’ll automatically start farming.

You’re in!

### Where to Check Farming Details

When you start farming, you can check out your current farms on the “My Farms’’ page. Here, you can check all the details on the farming events that you’re presently participating in.

On this page, you can also collect rewards, undeposit, and send your tokens to another account. If you click “View position”, you will see further details for each pool.
