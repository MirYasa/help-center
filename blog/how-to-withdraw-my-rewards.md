How to Start Farming on Algebra
===============================

In this how-to guide, you’ll get the whole scenario on how to start farming on Algebra and get great rewards.

Firstly, check out the available farming events on the “**Farming**” page (**Infinite Farms** and **Limit Farms**). [See the difference between Infinite Farms and Limit Farms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VaNo_HbVMstY30rA23BbOWdBmdifdoLjR94WMOiPFuE/edit#heading=h.dkekf791nv8).

To take part in farming, you’ll need a relevant pool of tokens (in other words - your NFT token). So, make sure you have it. If you don't, provide liquidity first and create a pool! To learn how to do it, read our [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_VbuE7CJDLPGdSTTvIrGikaqjfzUumsYi6H5U2Q0mRI/edit#heading=h.wyl6kj4stb9n).

Already got a relevant pool of tokens and ready to farm? Your next steps will be the following:

1.  Open [the Algebra dApp](https://app.algebra.finance/#/swap) and go to the “**Farming**" page.

2.  Choose “**Infinite Farms**" or “**Limit Farms**", and then choose a farming event that complies with your pool tokens. It can be USDC/WETH, ONE/IRIS, USDC/WMATIC, and so on.
