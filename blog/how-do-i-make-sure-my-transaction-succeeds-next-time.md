You can increase your chances of a successful transaction succeeding by changing the following parameters: 

1. **Transaction deadline** — you may extend the transaction deadline beyond 30 minutes through the Algebra interface advanced settings. Please keep in mind that this may lead to your trade executing at a subpar exchange rate as the market price may change during that time. 
2. **Slippage tolerance** — you may set a new slippage limit which is in other words — available price change. Please beware that increasing your slippage limit may result in an unexpectedly bad exchange rate. Your transaction may be frontrun. 
3. **Gas price** — setting a higher gas price will increase your chances of your transaction being processed by Ethereum miners more quickly. We recommend using data sites like <https://polygonscan.com/gastracker> to estimate a good gas price.
