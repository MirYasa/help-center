On Algebra, you can lock up your ALGB tokens for a certain period of time (30 minutes minimum) and earn staking rewards. Staking is a good way to make your idle crypto work for you. The more you stake - the higher the rewards.

Staking works in the following way:

\-Your tokens will be locked for 30 min. During this time, it's impossible to unstake or transfer your ALGB tokens.

\-The rewards are paid out in the form of ALGB tokens.

\-Your ALGB earned from staking is automatically restaked 

\-The amount of minted ALGB and the staking rewards depend on the amount of funds you locked up on the platform. 

\-Users can also add extra tokens to staking at any time, and withdraw partially or completely.

\-10% of all the trade fees are distributed as rewards. The average APR is 15%, it depends on the number of total locked tokens and the amount of fees.
