If you provide liquidity and your position gets out of range, you can choose between active and passive LP strategies.Â 

In case you choose active LP, you can withdraw your funds and create a new position with suitable price range settings. Otherwise, you can wait until the price will get back into the range.

In case you are taking part in a farming event, your funds are being locked, and you cannot withdraw or change a price range till the end of the event.
